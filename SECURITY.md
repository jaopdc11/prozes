## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Prozes seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not** Open a Public Issue

Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities, as this could put users at risk.

### 2. Report Privately

Send a detailed report to: **jao.pdc11@gmail.com**

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### 3. What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity within 7 days
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed about our progress
- **Fix**: We will work on a fix and release a patch as soon as possible
- **Credit**: If you wish, we will credit you in the release notes and CHANGELOG

### 4. Disclosure Policy

- We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline
- We aim to release security fixes within 30 days of a verified report

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using Prozes:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of Prozes
2. **Review Generated Code**: Always review the code generated by Prozes before using it in production
3. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies in generated projects up to date
4. **Virtual Environments**: Use virtual environments (use `--venv` flag) to isolate project dependencies
5. **Sensitive Information**: Never commit `.env` files or credentials to version control

## Known Security Considerations

### Generated Projects

Prozes generates project templates that include:
- Basic project structure
- Configuration files
- Dependency specifications

**Important**:
- Generated projects are starting points and should be reviewed and hardened for production use
- Add proper authentication, authorization, and input validation to generated projects
- Follow OWASP guidelines for web applications
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

### Dependencies

We carefully vet our dependencies:
- `click` - Command-line interface framework
- `rich` - Terminal formatting

We regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.

## Security Features in Generated Projects

Projects generated by Prozes include:
- `.gitignore` files to prevent committing sensitive files
- Separate configuration files for different environments
- Requirements files for dependency management
